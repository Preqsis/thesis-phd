First and foremost, I want to express special thanks to my wife, Karol√≠na, who always believes in me and has shown almost supernatural levels of patience and support over the years. 

Next, I thank my supervisor Filip Hroch and research consultant Viktor Votruba. These two gentlemen provided me with invaluable insights and a more experienced point of view into my research and the world of astrophysics in general. 

Also, my gratitude goes to everyone who pushed me, even a little, on my educational journey or sparked an interest in me into something new. For example, my 6th-grade physics teacher or my parents through the endless supply of encyclopedias. I will remember you all until my last day.
