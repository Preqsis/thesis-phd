Accretion of various types is one of the prevalent mechanisms by which matter is distributed and mixed in the universe. Primary focus of this study is computer modeling of accretion disks, and in particular, accretion disks of Cataclysmic Variable stars.

In Chapter \ref{chap:accretion_disks}, we start by defining what we mean by the term accretion and the different types of accreting systems, their basic characteristics, and a few notable examples of such systems. We then discuss different types of accretion disk models in relation to the \emph{Eddington luminosity limit}, and an extra focus is given to the Shakura-Sunyaev $\alpha$-disk model, which is also referred to as the \emph{stardard thin model}. It is the $\alpha$-disk model whose parameters, and mainly the free parameter $\alpha$, that we aim he get by utilizing our models discussed in the latter chapters.

Chapter \ref{chap:dripping_faucet} provides an overview of different types of dripping faucets models and of the theory behind them. There are also simulation results examples attached, that were made by the author and are based on the discussed theory and previos work by \citep{kveton2014}. \citep{kveton2014} 

Chapter \ref{chap:multilayer_dripping_handrail} focuses primarily on the definition of our \emph{Multilayer Dripping Handrail} model (MDH) and its parameters. This chapter also aims to provide precise explanations of algorithms and processes used to simulate this system and methods by which we extract synthetic observations from the dynamical matter flow simulation results.
