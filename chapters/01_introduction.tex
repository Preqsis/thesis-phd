Accretion of various types is one of the prevalent mechanims by witch the matter is distributed and mixed in the universe. In this study the primary focus is computer modeling of accretion disks, and in particular accretion disks of Cataclysmic Variable stars.

In Chapter \ref{chap:accretion_disks} we start by defining what we actually mean by the term accretion, and also the diferent types of accreting systems and treir basic charachteristics and few notable examples of such systems. The evolution in the field of accretion disks modeling is then discused and a particalar focus is given to the Shakura-Sunyaev $\alpha$-disk model, that is also refered to as the \emph{stardard model}. It is the $\alpha$-model whose parameters, and mainly the free parameter $\alpha$, we aim he get by utilizing our models discused in latter chapters.
