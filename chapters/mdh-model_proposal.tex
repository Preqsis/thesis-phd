\chapter{MDH -- MODEL PROPOSAL}
\thispagestyle{empty}

I propose a model constructed of \emph{n} times \emph{m} individual cells arranged in multi-layer ringlike structure. Each layer (i.e. ring) is denoted by $i \in [0; n-1]$, with the outermost layer having $i = 0$ and cells in each layer are denoted by $j \in [0; m-1]$ \footnote{Direction of $j$ iteration is arbitrary and a matter of perspective (i.e top vs. bottom view).}. Each cell holds a set of parameters and its behavior is governed by set of oridinary differential equations derived from Mass-Spring model so fundamentally every cell is its own \emph{dripping faucet} system so lets start by defining individual cell.  

\section{Cell definition}
The imagined cell holds following set of parameters:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r|l}
$i$			& Layer index \\
$j$			& Cell index \\
$r$			& Orbital radius \\
$\theta$	& Orbital azimuth \\ 
$z$			& Mass spring model \emph{spring elongation}  \\
$v$			& Mass-Spring model \emph{velocity} \\
$m$			& Mass contained by cell \\
$\Delta m$ 	& Mass change since previous step \\
$g$			& Gravitational acceleration relative to outermost layer \\
$\gamma$	& Constant Mass-Spring model dumpening parameter \\
$k$			& Mass-Spring model \emph{spring stiffness} \\
$T$			& Cell temperature \\ 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
