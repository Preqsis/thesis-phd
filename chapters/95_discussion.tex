    Over the course of this publication we provided a detailed description of our \emph{Multilayer accretion disc} (MDH) model (see Chapter~\ref{chap:multilayer_dripping_handrail}), did an overview of its specific code implementation (see Chapter~\ref{chap:model_implementation}), nad demostrated its capabilities on chosen generic CV system using several model configurations (see Chapter~\ref{chap:cv_models}). We then used these results to obtain specific values of Shakura-Sunyaev $\alpha$ parameter for each configuration. 

    In this last Chapter, we would like to disscuss the successes, limitations or failures regarding the specific topics of our research journey with the MDH model. Also we want to provide some questions, ideas or inspirations for our future research or the related research of others.
